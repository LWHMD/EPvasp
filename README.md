EPvasp is a python tool that used to extract data from vasp outputs of electronic properties calculation 
How this script can help you ?
1) This script can be used to extract data after you performing DFT and HSE band structure calculation. 
2) This script can help you extract data, even if you high symmetry kpoints is non-uniform. 
3) It can be used to extrat data from PROCAR.
I wil add some examples later.
